Hiya! Iâ€™ll be your head TA this summer â€” feel free to reach out
to me with questions, no matter how small you think they be ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™m an incoming grad student in EECS at UC Berkeley, advised by
James Demmel. I also did my undergrad at Cal and have done/do
research in using Bayesian Statistics to improve High-Performant
Systems (yes, this does include LLMs), as well as NLP, Deep RL,
Graphics (NeRFs specifically!), and CS Education.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new things. Before this
summer session, Iâ€™ve spent my time traveling, hiking, and
learning languages. Iâ€™ve also spent a lot of time cleaning up
old side projects and reading! Looking forward to learning with
everyone this summer :D
