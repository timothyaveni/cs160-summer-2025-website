Hi! I’m a senior from Southern California. My current academic passions are web technologies and human-centered design. Before transferring to Berkeley, I studied pre-med at Mt San Jacinto College, so I’m especially interested in medical devices and how people interact with them.

Outside of CS, I adore drawing with charcoal, fiction writing, and watching anime with my wife. I also do a lot of video gaming and movie-watching.
