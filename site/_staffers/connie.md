Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at the School of Information, advised by Kimiko Ryokai. My research explores human-AI collaboration, creativity and play, and digital wellbeing. I design and study tools and experiences that foster creativity, empathy, and collaboration with emerging technologies.

I double majored in Media Arts & Sciences and Psychology as an undergrad, and was part of the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. Outside of research, I enjoy skiing, eating ice cream, and playing board games.
