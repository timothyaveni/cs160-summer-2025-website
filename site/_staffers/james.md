I'm a 6th year PhD student studying Human Computer Interaction with Bjoern Hartmann, focusing on presence while interacting with computational systems. In particular, I study Virtual Reality interfaces and the relationship that people have with their bodies while in them.

Prior to grad school, I worked as a software engineer in the video game industry as a gameplay programmer, and worked on backend platform systems. I got my undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley EECS as well as an MS degree through the 5th year MS program here. I'm happy to talk about my experience with that program or industry!

I spend my free time with two toy poodles and my lovely wife. You'll also find me playing video games, rotting on the couch, or learning to cook something new (inbox is open to dank recipes).
