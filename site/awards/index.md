This semester, the course theme was **novel intelligent user interfaces**.

## Best use of artificial intelligence

Awarded to the team with the most interesting or impressive combination of user interface and backing artificial intelligence.

## "Ship it!" — most polished

Awarded to the team whose final prototype is solidly built and practically ready to deploy to the general public, with solid interactions, polished design, and firm implementation.
