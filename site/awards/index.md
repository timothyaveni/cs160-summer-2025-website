The course-wide final project was a team effort, with teams conducting user interviews, building low- and high-fidelity prototypes of software designs, and ultimately showing off their final prototype in an in-class demo session. This semester, the course theme was **novel intelligent user interfaces**.

Three teams were selected as winners of the following awards:

## Best use of artificial intelligence

Awarded to the team with the most interesting or impressive combination of user interface and backing artificial intelligence.

Placeholder!

## Most compelling user story

Awarded to the team who best demonstrated the process of user-centered design, learning from and adapting to users' needs.

Placeholder!

## "Ship it!" â€” most polished

Awarded to the team whose final prototype is solidly built and practically ready to deploy to the general public, with solid interactions, polished design, and firm implementation.
