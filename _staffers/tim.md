Hi!! I'm your instructor this semester.

I'm a PhD student here at UC Berkeley, advised by [Bj√∂rn Hartmann](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/) and [Armando Fox](https://www.armandofox.com/). I research human-computer interaction, recently with a particular focus on how AI can help people build digital workflows.

Before coming to UC Berkeley, I was a software engineer at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), working on [fighting misinformation](https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/misinformation), and then a senior software engineer at [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/), working on the [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) product.

In my spare time, I really enjoy studying languages. Most recently, my focus is on Mandarin! You'll also catch me talking to myself in broken French, Spanish, and ASL.
