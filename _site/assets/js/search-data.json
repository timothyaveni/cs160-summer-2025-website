Welcome to CS 160! This semester, you’ll learn about foundational human-computer interaction (HCI) principles and, simultaneously, put those principles into practice by building functional prototypes of UI solutions for real people. This course is designed to give you a solid basis for designing and implementing user interfaces in industry or for studying human-computer interaction in an academic context. This is a team-based class; you will be matched with classmates in teams of three to five people, and you’ll work with those teammates to brainstorm, study the needs of a chosen group of users, and ultimately design and build a high-fidelity prototype of software to address that user group’s needs. This class is taught using the Web platform, meaning your final project result will take the form of a Web application or a PWA, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While lecture will largely focus on teaching you principles of HCI, you’ll also be taught in discussion section what you need to know to build out a prototype Web application. In recent semesters (including this one!), CS 160 has often taken a focus on projects that integrate tightly with AI. By the end of this course, you’ll have experience using modern AI techniques to quickly create user interfaces that were difficult or impossible to build even just a few years ago. It’s an exciting time for HCI, and we’re hoping that after this course, you’ll go out and help build the future of user interface design! . ",

    "title": "Attendance",
    "content": "Attendance is required for all course sessions: that’s four lectures a week plus two discussion section meetings. Lectures and discussion sections will not be recorded for general availability. In addition, there will be two exams during the semester for which you will need to schedule and attend a (flexible) time slot. By attending regularly, you’ll be able to participate in class activities, meet with your team when needed (especially in discussion sections), and avoid falling behind. Since summer sessions are so fast-paced, it can be really hard to catch up if you do start to lag behind the rest of the class. The following attendance policy applies equally to all students. Absences are intended to be used in situations where illnesses and other surprises of life get in the way of attendance. We don’t check doctor’s notes or otherwise police the use of these absences; we trust you to use them responsibly. There’s not much wiggle room in the summer semester; keep in mind that a double-paced semester won’t also double-pace the rest of your life! If you get sick during the semester, you won’t recover twice as fast just because it’s the summer semester. I strongly encourage you to attend every session you are capable of attending, because if you do use up your absences early in the semester, you may end up overly constraining your flexibility for the later weeks. For these eight weeks, we’re focused. There’s no room to take a week-long vacation! . If you do have medical or other serious factors come up that affect your attendance on a longer horizon during the semester, do reach out to course staff as soon as you can. We can make accommodations in many cases. Often, however, circumstances that would be possible to work around in a typical fall/spring semester are tricky to resolve in our shorter timeframe. Students who miss too much of the course may be better-served by a retroactive medical withdrawal. | Absences | Penalty | . | Absent 0-5 sessions | No grade penalty | . | Absent 6-7 sessions | 3 percentage point grade penalty | . | Absent 8-9 sessions | 8 percentage point grade penalty | . | Absent 10-12 sessions | 15 percentage point grade penalty | . | Absent 13+ sessions | 0/25 for the course participation grade category | . Note that this policy refers to sessions, not days: if you miss lecture and discussion section on the same day, this will count as multiple absences. We have two holidays during the semester, and discussion sections will begin on the first Thursday of the semester. This amounts to around 44 total course sessions this semester. In addition to the above attendance policy, you are responsible for assignments that were completed in part during class. If you are absent for a discussion section during which your team worked on a component of the final project, you should expect to coordinate your workload with your team so that everyone has contributed fairly to the final presentables. If you are absent during an in-class activity that cannot be made up later, course staff may excuse your grade for that activity in the gradebook (but the absence will still count toward your total as described above). You are expected to attend the entirety of each session. If you arrive late or leave early from a session, your marked attendance for that section will be at the discretion of course staff. Before most class sessions, we’ll ask you if you’re present in the room. It’s okay if you can’t attend every session! That’s why our attendance policy allows for the occasional absence. If you misrepresent your attendance, however, (e.g. by having a friend sign you in), you (and your friend!) will incur some additional penalty (and will not earn attendance credit). The nature of this penalty (e.g. a further grade deduction or a referral to the Center for Student Conduct) will be at the discretion of the course instructors. We hope we never have to deal with this; it’s a lot easier for us to work with you if you tell us the truth about your attendance! . In lecture, you’ll often be asked to interact with the lecture using the same device you used to check into class (probably a laptop). You’re expected to stay engaged with lecture and participate throughout; you will not necessarily earn attendance credit if you do not participate after your initial check-in. That said, we’re not looking to police this aggressively; it’s okay to miss the occasional clicker question if you’re not sure of the answer or you need to use the bathroom. ",

Make sure you understand your work, though, since there’s a reason we’re having you practice this stuff. You’re not allowed to copy code straight from your classmates. Consulting sites like StackOverflow or using large language models to help you code is also okay, but you should stick to asking methodically for what you need as you need it. You’re not allowed to just slap an entire assignment description into an LLM and have it spit out an implementation, but you can use things like GitHub Copilot (free for students, by the way!) to assist with the boring bits as you work through writing code yourself. I do it all the time, myself! . For code in your final project prototype, where we’re not specifically working on training your Web programming skills, you’re even more free to use large language models if you find they’re helping you skip the tedious parts of building your application (e.g. the CRUDdy bits). What we’re excited about is seeing you build the unique, innovative UIs that your target user group needs, not seeing how good you are at making login pages and other boring stuff an LLM can help you flesh out. Just be mindful of code quality when you’re doing this! Use LLMs the same way you would in a professional software engineering job. Exams will be administered in a computer-based testing facility (CBTF), which will prevent you from accessing disallowed resources during the exam.

This info is just for us to get to know you better, and we won’t share your responses beyond our course staff or keep this personal information around after the semester is over. During the semester, please let us know if you’d like to make any changes to the personal information you shared with us (since we might not notice if you just fill out the form again once we’re further into the semester).
